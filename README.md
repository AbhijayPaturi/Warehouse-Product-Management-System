# Warehouse-Product-Management-System
WPMS (Warehouse Product Management System) is a warehouse product information and management website where warehouse employees can track, view, and update the products entering and exiting their warehouse.

## Description
The intended audience are warehouse employees looking to digitize their warehouse by maintain a central product management and information system. In doing so, they can reduce operational inefficiencies like finding a piece of paper somewhere in a file cabinet with the location and information about a product in the warehouse. A warehouse employee can register clients who they need to ship a certain product to; view all the products in the warehouse, even by applying filters; view the details and a photo of each product they click on; add products that the warehouse recently received to the database; delete certain products from the database; and ship a product to a client if the quantity of that product is available in the warehouse.
